Water Race Game
===============

This is a 3D web game built using BabylonJS, React and Vite. In this game, you navigate a ship through a water race track and compete against other ships. The game is designed to be easy to play but challenging to master.

How to Play
-----------

1.  Use the WASD or arrow keys to control the ship's movement.
2.  Avoid colliding with the walls or other ships, as this will slow you down.
3.  Collect power-ups to gain an advantage over your opponents.
4.  Finish the race in the shortest time possible to win.
